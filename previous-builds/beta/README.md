## 1. Eventbrite API

Have you ever felt indecisive and needed some help with planning out a trip with your friends? Have you ever missed out on special events or felt confused about choosing where to visit on weekends or find activities to explore a new city with your friends? Our app will provide you the support you need, using the Yelp, Eventbrite and TripAdvisor API to provide recommendations on new places to try out based on your and your friendsâ€™ input preferences on food, and hobbies, and map out the trip for you. The app can provide you a detailed agenda for a given timeframe. From activities to the restaurants to grab food, this app will guides you to have a meaningful trip, a quality weekend with your friends, and explore a city blissfully. 

## 2. News API

Have you ever felt indecisive and needed some help deciding? Our app will provide you the support you need to find out how public reaction is like about news articles and events in areas. On a map we will provide emotions based on how people via Twitter are reacting to events in that area, such as an election or maybe hopefully not a natural disaster. Each area will have different emotions assigned to it based on how they feel about news in that area. A heat map filter will allow users to see a range of emotions on the map from happy to sad.
