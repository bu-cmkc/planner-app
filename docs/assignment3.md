# Assignment #3

What you see in our prototype is a Node Express server to handle our API calls and backend logic coupled with a React app for our frontend. We had heavily deliberated using Python and Flask before we decided on using the MERN stack to develop our application (although we have not yet decided on the exact formatting of our user accounts and preferences data, we knew that we did not need the need of a relational database, so we plan on using MongoDB later on to store our user information). 

Weighing between the benefits of different stacks, we found a lot of information to consider:
* Flask was more appealing due to the fact that most of us were more familiar with Python than JavaScript.
* Node is faster (adaptation from Chrome’s V8 engine), and since we may have to fetch and display many quantities of information from different APIs to generate what we needed for our app, performance was an important quality we looked for.
* The MERN stack revolves almost entirely around JavaScript as the main language across the entire stack, making it much easier to communicate between the front and back ends compared to other tech stacks.
* JavaScript is also really popular, so it would be good to learn it now to help us in our future careers.

With all of the above points to consider, and above all that our team’s willingness to learn, we decided to use the MERN stack to develop our application.
