# User Story 1

  A fresh visit to the web app should ask users to register through Oauth to enter the website. If the user has already registered, signing in through Oauth should prompt users to be redirected to the main content screen. If the user tries to access the web app without being logged in, they should be redirected to this splash screen / login screen.

Main idea: User can register/login the account with the google account (or email) and password
oauth
  - forget account/password
  - If register, add email, password, username(?)
  - After registration or login the app will direct user to main screen.a
  - Every page redirects to this page if not logged in
