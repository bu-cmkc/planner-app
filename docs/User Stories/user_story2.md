  If the user hasn’t already done so, once logged in, the web app should prompt users to input and set their preferences pertaining to trip location, types of activities, restaurants, and hobbies, and the trip duration. Their preferences will be sorted on a list, which they can drag accordingly to arrange the rank of their preferences. Users can then input additional preferences such as ‘best matches,’ ‘cheapest,’ and ‘shortest distance.’	

Main Idea: In the application, user can set, edit and rank preferences by selecting the location, activities, types of restaurants, hobbies, and duration (time frame).
  - Add new preference button to create a preference (if there is no list show that user must add a preference , else show list of preferences with a title(?) )
  - Tapping a preference will ask user to edit or use the preference 
  - Rearrange the preferences (filter?) by dragging or by entering a number (if enter a number we need to make sure no duplicate rankings)
  - After editing the personal preference, tap the ranking button by Best Matches, Expensive-Cheap, Distance
