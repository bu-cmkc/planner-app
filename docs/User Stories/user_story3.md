  Users, once they have specified their preferences, can then generate a suggested agenda based on the preferences they inputted earlier. They can edit the suggested agenda with suggested alternatives or change the timeline of events to better suit their schedule. However, they cannot move certain events that are only available for that timeframe, such as moving a dinner past the restaurantâ€™s closing times. Users can also manually input their own events into the suggested agenda, and save their favorite agendas for future use.

Main Idea: User can see the suggested agenda made based on the preference and edit the suggested agenda with a list of alternatives or change the order of suggested activities (search?)
  - User can change the order of the agenda, but cannot move certain events that are only available for that time frame  out of the scope when the event is happening, or if a restaurant is not open at a certain hour, restrict the user
  - User can also search and manually select a restaurant or event for a certain time slot
  - User can save their favorite suggested agenda(s) for future use
