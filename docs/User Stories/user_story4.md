# User Story 4

  Once a user has settled on a particular agenda they want to pursue, they have the option to see their agenda route mapped onto Google Maps. This way, they can best determine whether a particular agenda has a better route than another agenda that best suits their needs. This feature can only be used if the user has indicated that they have a car to use for the trip in the preferences panel.

Main idea: User can see the route for the agenda mapped on the google maps
  - User can pick which public transportation to use (Walk, Train, Bus, etc) If the option that user picked exceed the duration, show a warning dialog?
  - If user picks to drive with their own car, google map will show the route and lead the user to final destination
